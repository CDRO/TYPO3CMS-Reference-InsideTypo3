Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

ImageMagick has been used since the dawn of times by TYPO3. What we
didn't know back then is that ImageMagick would have a record of
changing APIs all the time which has been a real pain in the behind
for us during the years. Also certain features has been changed, some
has been made significantly slower, some removed totally and some got
a poorer quality in our opinion. All this has lead to the
recommendation of using ImageMagick 4.2.9 - a 6 years old version.

Starting with TYPO3 3.8.0, support for GraphicsMagick has been
introduced. GraphicsMagick is a fork of ImageMagick whose mission is
to build a more stable version of ImageMagick â€“ which is really the
case.

Refer to the Install Tool for more information about using
GraphicsMagick. Usually it should be detected automatically and be
preferred over ImageMagick if both are found. We recommend to use it
and forget about all those ImageMagick troubles...

The following pages contain old notes about the ImageMagick problems.
They are preserved for historical reasons mostly.
