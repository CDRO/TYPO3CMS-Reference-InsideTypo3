config\_default.php
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The localconf.php file and equivalents from extensions are included
from the config\_default.php file. This file will set the default
values in the $TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS array. This is also the ultimate
source for information about each configuration option available! So
please take a look into the source code of that file if you want to
browse the full array of options you can apply!

This is a snippet from that file::

   <?php
   /**
   * TYPO3 default configuration
   *
   * TYPO3_CONF_VARS is a global array with configuration for the TYPO3 libraries
   * THESE VARIABLES MAY BE OVERRIDDEN FROM WITHIN localconf.php
   *
   * 'IM' is short for 'ImageMagick', which is an external image manipulation package available from www.imagemagick.org. Version is ABSOLUTELY preferred to be 4.2.9, but may be 5+. See the install notes for TYPO3!!
   * 'GD' is short for 'GDLib/FreeType', which are libraries that should be compiled into PHP4. GDLib <=1.3 supports GIF, while the latest version 1.8.x and 2.x supports only PNG. GDLib is available from www.boutell.com/gd/. Freetype has a link from there.

   $TYPO3_CONF_VARS = Array(
       'GFX' => array(        // Configuration of the image processing features in TYPO3. 'IM' and 'GD' are short for ImageMagick and  GD library respectively.
           'image_processing' => 1,                // Boolean. Enables image processing features. Disabling this means NO image processing with either GD or IM!
           'thumbnails' => 1,                        // Boolean. Enables the use of thumbnails in the backend interface. Thumbnails are generated by IM/partly GD in the file typo3/thumbs.php
           'thumbnails_png' => 0,                    // Bits. Bit0: If set, thumbnails from non-jpegs will be 'png', otherwise 'gif' (0=gif/1=png). Bit1: Even JPG's will be converted to png or gif (2=gif/3=png)
           'gif_compress' => 1,                    // Boolean. Enables the use of the t3lib_div::gif_compress() workaround function for compressing giffiles made with GD or IM, which probably use only RLE or no compression at all.
