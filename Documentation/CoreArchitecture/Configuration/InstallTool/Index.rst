Install Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In relation to configuration the Install Tool does some configuration
automatically from the Basic Configuration menu item. But specifically
the menu item "All Configuration" will list all options found in
$TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS and also read out the comments from the
config\_default.php file! So this is basically the visual editor of
the $TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS variable!
