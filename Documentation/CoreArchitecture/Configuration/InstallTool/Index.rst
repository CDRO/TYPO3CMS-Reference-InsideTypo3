Install Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Install Tool provides a convenient user interface for changing
the global configuration. The "All Configuration" view lists all
available options and makes them available for editing.

When changes are saved, the :file:`LocalConfiguration.php` file
is updated.

Note how the configuration options description is taken from the
values in the :file:`typo3/sysext/core/Configuration/DefaultConfigurationDescription.yml`
file.
