Browsing $TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the module Tools > Configuration (extension key: lowlevel), you can
also browse the $TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS array and its values:

|img-31|

**Notice:** This module is merely a browser letting you comfortably
investigate the values configured - you can  *not* change the values
(although it might seem an obvious thing to add). There are currently
no plans about adding that capability.
