Filelist module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The File > Filelist module is the interface to the servers file system
through TYPO3. It's a kind of webbased FTP client offering the user to
upload files, create new files and folders, rename them and delete
them. You can also copy / paste files and folders. This is all done by
the Context Sensitive Menus (CSM) inside the module - just click an
icon of a file or folder and you will find the options at your
disposal.
