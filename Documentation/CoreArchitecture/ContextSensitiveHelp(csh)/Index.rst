Context Sensitive Help (CSH)
----------------------------

TYPO3 offers a full API for adding Context Sensitive Help to
especially all database tables and fields. This is normally expressed
by small comments and an icon linking to a window with a full
explanation of a field - or a feature in a module if you choose to use
it in that way.

In the example above the context sensitive help appears when "Show
field descriptions" is enabled.
